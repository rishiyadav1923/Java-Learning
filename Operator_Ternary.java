//* Ternary Operator :-
/*
Java ternary operator is the only conditional operator that takes three operands. Itâ€™s a one-liner replacement for the if-then-else statement and is used
a lot in Java programming. We can use the ternary operator in place of if-else conditions or even switch conditions using nested ternary operators.
Although it follows the same algorithm as of if-else statement, the conditional operator takes less space and helps to write the if-else statements
in the shortest way possible.

* Conditions of Ternary Operator are within these Symbols (?:)
               ____Resultant Value______________
              |             ____________       |
             \/            |   True    \/     |

Syntax :- Variable = Expression1 ? Expression2 : Expression3
             /\            |          False       /\    |

}

Example
num1 = 10;
num2 = 20;

res=(num1>num2) ? (num1+num2):(num1-num2)

Since num1<num2,
the second operation is performed
res = num1-num2 = -10
